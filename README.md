# ðŸšŒ Real-Time Transit Delay Prediction using GTFS Data

This project implements a scalable, end-to-end machine learning system for predicting real-time delays in public transit using GTFS-static and GTFS-realtime datasets. It features an automated cloud-based ETL pipeline, feature engineering, model training, and real-time prediction interface using Python and Streamlit.
